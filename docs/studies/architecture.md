## What is Software Architecture

Uncle Bob Martin on Twitter: "The goal of software architecture is the minimization of manpower in all phases of development, deployment, and maintenance."

To remedy this problem we formalize the Intension and
the Locality criteria, which imply that the distinction between architecture, design, and implementation is qualitative and not merely quantitative. We demonstrate that architectural styles are intensional and non-local; that design
patterns are intensional and local; and that implementations are extensional and local.
