Software Development Study Project

In this project, my main goal is to develop a web-based Digital Market while studying and sharing various concepts and strategies related to the software development lifecycle that are widely used in projects in 2023.

The first step of this project involves gathering the requirements and specifications that are commonly mentioned in job descriptions from around the world. By analyzing these requirements, I aim to organize and summarize them effectively.

Once the requirements are gathered and organized, the next step is to create a project roadmap that outlines the planned steps and milestones. Additionally, I will develop a TODO list to track the progress and completion of each task.
